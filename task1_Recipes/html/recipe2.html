<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Olive oil, for coating and frying</li>
    <li>4 baking potatoes</li>
    <li>4 medium beetroots, beets scrubbed, stalks chopped</li>
    <li>1 banana shallot, finely sliced</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, finely sliced</li>
    <li>400g can white beans (haricot, cannellini, butter or similar), drained and rinsed
    </li>
    <li>1 tsp white wine vinegar
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>10g unsalted butter</li>

</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Heat the oven to 200°C fan/gas 7. Rub a little oil over each potato and season with salt. Do the same with the beets (cutting any very large ones in half), then wrap those in foil. Put both directly on a shelf in the oven and bake for about 50 minutes (or 20 if you’ve given them a 10-minute blast in the microwave first). The potatoes are done when the skin is crisp and the potato is soft inside, and the beetroot should yield easily to the point of a knife.</p></li>
    <li><p>Around 15 minutes before the potatoes and beets will be ready, prepare the filling. Heat a dash of oil in a saucepan over a low-medium heat then add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and beetroot stalks and cook for another 5 minutes until softened.</p></li>
    <li><p>Stir the beans into the shallot mixture. After a few minutes, add 3 tbsp sour cream and the vinegar. Stir until combined and creamy then season, adding plenty of black pepper.</p></li>
    <li><p>Split open the jacket potatoes and add the butter. Divide the bean mixture among the potatoes then cut the beetroot into wedges and put them on top. Spoon on the remaining soured cream then sprinkle over the dill.</p></li>
