    <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
</ul>

<b>For the horseradish cream</b>
<ul>
    <li>200ml double cream</li>
    <li>2 tbsp horseradish sauce</li>
    <li>Juice 1 lemon</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>You’ll also need</b>
<ul>
    <li>Eco-friendly cling film</li>
    <li>Heavyweights such as tins of beans</li>
    <li>Baking sheet lined with floured compostable baking paper</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>For the gravadlax, mix the salt, sugar, pepper and dill. Put the piece of salmon skin-side down on a large sheet of the cling film, then cover with the salt mixture and press it evenly all over the flesh. Wrap tightly, then pierce a few holes in the cling film on each side to allow liquid to escape during curing.</p></li>
    <li><p>Put the wrapped salmon in a non-metallic dish, then top with a second dish and weigh down with tins of beans or anything heavy that can go in the fridge. Chill for 24 hours, then turn over the fish, weigh down and chill for another 24 hours (see Make Ahead).</p></li>
    <li><p>For the soda bread, heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Mix the milk and lemon juice in a jug, then set aside for 1-2 minutes to thicken – it will split slightly but that’s fine. Stir in the golden syrup until combined.</p></li>
    <li><p>Put the flour, salt and bicarb in a large mixing bowl, then pour in the milk mixture. Stir well to make a sticky dough, then tip onto a floured surface. Using floured hands, shape into a ball about 18cm across, then transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Flour the handle of a wooden spoon and use it to make a deep cross in the top of the loaf. Bake for 35-40 minutes until risen, golden and the base of the loaf makes a hollow sound when tapped. Cool completely on a rack (see Make Ahead).</p></li>
    <li><p>Whisk all the ingredients for the horseradish cream together until just holding soft peaks that flop over when you remove the whisk. Season and chill until ready to serve (see Make Ahead).</p></li>
    <li><p>After 48 hours of curing, remove the salmon from the curing mixture (wipe off and discard any mixture). Finely slice the gravadlax skin-side down and serve with slices of soda bread, the horseradish cream, ground black pepper and extra dill.</p></li>
